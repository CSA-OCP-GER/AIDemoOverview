|Knowledge Mining with Azure OpenAI| The purpose of this repo is to accelerate the deployment of a Python-based Knowledge Mining solution with OpenAI that will ingest a Knowledge Base, generate embeddings using the contents extracted, store them in a vector search engine (Redis), and use that engine to answer queries / questions specific to that Knowledge Base. The repo includes the use of MRKL/ReAct Prompts and the ability to ask questions of different stores (including mathematical operations). | Azure OpenAI; LangChain; Cognitive Search, Vector Store   | Automotive, Banking, Energy, Media   | [Link] (https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us) | Productivity, Knowledge Finding | Solution Architects  | Material | [Link](https://github.com/MSUSAzureAccelerators/Knowledge-Mining-with-OpenAI)

| Athena - Generate Synapse queries with Azure OpenAI  | We know that LLMs can generate SQL code from Natural language. The challenge in adopting this to empower all skill levels to query big data is many fold. From LLM perspective: For a correct SQL query generation from natural langugae, LLMs not only need to understad the context but also have an understanding of the database schema. Passing schema to prompts could be an approach here but this is not scalable. In this repo we showcase using prompt engineering approaches from chain of thought modelling we can make this approach scalable. This project shows LLMs working from natural language to query a star schema in data lake (via Synapse) without the need to know the DB schema before hand. | Technologies   | Industries   | Reference | KPIs | Audience   | Material | [Link](https://github.com/Ritaja/Athena)
| Azure OpenAI Embeddings QnA | A simple web application for a OpenAI-enabled document search. This repo uses Azure OpenAI Service for creating embeddings vectors from documents. For answering the question of a user, it retrieves the most relevant document and then uses GPT-3 to extract the matching answer for the question. | Technologies   | Industries   | Reference | KPIs | Audience   | Material | [Link](https://github.com/ruoccofabrizio/azure-open-ai-embeddings-qna)
